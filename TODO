- [X] allocate pages in RuntimeServiceData pool as UEFI driver
- [ ] run EFI_RUNTIME_DXE driver and allocate MMIO pages
  - [ ] then what? how to process memory reads/writes?
- [ ] make SMM driver that processes SmmDriverOrder
- [ ] make SMM drivers that is able to monitor other SMM drivers
- [ ] vendor-defined ACPI tables to locate BPB address
  - extending/overriding DSDT is possible in both linux and windows
  - [X] EFI loader installs SSDT with patched AML
  - [ ] EFI loader installs BPBT and SSDT which refers to BPBT
  - [ ] EFI loader installs BPBT but SSDT is pulled from win32 registry
- [ ] probe address in wdm driver
  - [X] just use MmIoMapSpace
  - [X] use IoReportResourceForDetection/IoReportDetectedDevice
    - does not work
      - because any address reported by WDM driver conflicts
        with EFI memory map regions (including our own)
  - [ ] use IoReportRootDevice
    - dispatch IRP_MN_START_DEVICE and IRP_QUERY_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] access EFI system table in windows
  - [ ] reading configuration tables in windows
